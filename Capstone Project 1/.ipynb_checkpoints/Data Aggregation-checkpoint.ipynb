    "1. 12 files were read and aggregated, one for each month in 2017\n",
    "2. Original data included ~9.5 million records per month. For each month, data was filtered to include only regular cab rides (not group rides or airport rides, etc), then sorted by `pickup time`, and finally sampled to include every 400th record.\n",
    "3. A subset of the columns were chosen; non-relevant columns were dropped.\n",
    "4. After sampling, the dataset for each month was aggregated into a single file for the year of 2017: ~260K records.\n",
    "5. The aggregated data was saved as `tripdata_2017.csv` and will be used in the next steps of the [Data Wrangling](./Data%20Wrangling.ipynb) process.\n",

    "**Note:** The original data files (containing all data) have been compressed into a file `tripdata_2017_compressed.zip` and will need to be unzipped if you wish to repeat the data aggregation process. This has been done to save memory."
